# markdown-to-pdf-automation
A pattern collecting meaningful user inputs, processing the data, and generating a formated output from it.

The script interacts with the user by prompting them for various details. You provide the requested information, which the script then stores. Once all necessary inputs are gathered, the script creates a file in Markdown - a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting conventions to produce rich text output. 

The Markdown is then converted to PDF, with the script handling the formatting and styling. This conversion can be done with tools like Pandoc, though many alternatives exist.

Finally, the temporary Markdown file is deleted, leaving only the generated PDF document.
